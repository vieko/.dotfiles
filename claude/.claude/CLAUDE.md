## Planning & Execution

### Task Classification

- **Quick fixes** (<30 min): Brief plan in response, no separate file needed
- **Feature work** (>30 min): Create plan in `specs/tasks/TASK_NAME.md`
- **Complex projects**: Full specification with research phase

### Planning Template (for non-trivial tasks)

1. **Context**: Why this task exists
2. **Approach**: High-level strategy (focus on MVP)
3. **Implementation steps**: Concrete, testable milestones
4. **Success criteria**: How we'll know it's done

### Execution Guidelines

- Update plan with discoveries/pivots as we go
- Document key decisions and trade-offs
- Clean up artifacts before review (temp files, logs, etc.)
- Prepare commit message but await review

### Communication

- Ask for clarification early rather than making assumptions
- Flag potential risks or alternative approaches
- Summarize completed work with what changed and why
