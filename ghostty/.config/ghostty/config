# NOTE: Using "no-cursor" to prevent shell from overriding cursor-style setting
# The cursor feature allows shell/vim to change cursor shape, but prevents
# our cursor-style=block and cursor-style-blink=false from working on startup

# OS-SPECIFIC SETTINGS
# Note: Ghostty does not currently support config includes like Kitty
# To use OS-specific settings:
# 1. Run ./setup-os-link.sh to create config-current symlink
# 2. Use config-current as your config (if supported by Ghostty)
# OR manually apply settings from config-macos/config-linux as needed
#
# For now on macOS, font-size should be 14 (set at line 8)
